# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, primarily focused on frontend development with React and Next.js. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in building scalable, high-performance applications, always aiming for clean and maintainable code.

Lately, I've been expanding my expertise into backend development, working with NestJS and PostgreSQL to build robust full-stack solutions. I love solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and continuously learning new technologies.
